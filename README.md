# text-detection-from-image-using-python
Curated a diverse dataset of text-containing images from reputable sources for training and evaluation.
Utilized PyTesseract and OCR libraries for accurate optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text from images.
Employed image preprocessing techniques, such as resizing and normalization, to optimize the dataset.
Developed algorithms for precise text region detection using image segmentation and object detection methods.
Trained deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to recognize and extract text.
Applied NLP techniques like tokenization, stemming, and named entity recognition to process and analyze the extracted text.
Evaluated system performance using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, iterating and optimizing the model accordingly.
Collaborated with a cross-functional team to integrate the system and align it with specific application requirements.
Successfully deployed the system, enabling automated text extraction for document digitization and image captioning.
By leveraging PyTesseract and OCR libraries, we achieved exceptional results in accurately extracting text from images. The system's potential to streamline processes and enhance data accessibility makes it a valuable contribution to the field.
